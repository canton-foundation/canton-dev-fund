# Canton Protocol Development Fund

The Canton Network Development Fund supports open development that strengthens the Canton ecosystem.

This repository is used to submit **Development Fund proposals** through GitHub Pull Requests.

---

## Overview

The Development Fund accelerates high-quality contributions that increase the utility, security, and long-term resilience of the Canton Network.

The fund supports work such as:

- Core protocol research and development  
- Developer tools and SDKs  
- Security reviews, audits, and hardening  
- Reference implementations  
- Critical ecosystem infrastructure  
- DeFi liquidity seeding where required for early utility  

If your proposal delivers a **shared benefit to the Canton ecosystem**, it may be eligible.

---

## How the Fund Works

The program was established through governance:

- **CIP-0082** allocates **5% of future Canton Coin emissions** to the Development Fund  
- **CIP-0100** defines the governance and review process  

Unlike many networks, Canton does **not** use a premine or treasury. Funding comes from future network rewards to create a durable, predictable source.

The Canton Foundation acts as a neutral facilitator.

Funding decisions are made by the **Tech & Ops Committee**, with final approval by the **Voting Group**.

**Program structure**

- Quarterly funding allocation  
- Milestone-based payments  
- Funding denominated in Canton Coin (CC)  
- Transparent, community-visible process  

---

## Who Can Submit

You may submit a proposal if you are:

- A Canton Foundation member  
- A contributor organization  
- An external team or individual  

External contributors must have a **Tech & Ops Committee champion** to support the proposal.

All proposals are evaluated based on **impact, quality, feasibility, and alignment**, not on who submits them.
