## Summary
The **Nexus Framework (NXFS)** bridges the integration gap between the Canton Ledger and modern web ecosystems (Next.js, React, TanStack). It introduces a type-safe ORPC layer that automates Isomorphic Authentication, Consensus-Aware State Syncing, and Strict Type-Safe API Generation, eliminating boilerplate and accelerating developer adoption for Canton network dApps.
