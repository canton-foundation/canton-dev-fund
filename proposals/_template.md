### Volatility Stipulation
If the project duration is **greater than 6 months**:

If the project duration is **under 6 months**:  
Should the project timeline extend beyond 6 months due to Committee-requested scope changes, any remaining milestones must be renegotiated to account for significant USD/CC price volatility.
