## Abstract

This proposal establishes the Canton Transparency Working Group (CTWG), a public-good contributor initiative designed to enhance governance clarity, Development Fund transparency, and standardized ecosystem reporting across the Canton Network.

CTWG introduces a structured governance mapping framework, a public-facing transparency dashboard (MVP), and a standardized quarterly transparency reporting model to strengthen ecosystem visibility and long-term resilience as Canton adoption scales.

---

## Specification

### 1. Objective

As Canton adoption accelerates, governance visibility, milestone tracking, and Development Fund transparency become increasingly important.

The objective of this initiative is to:

- Standardize public governance documentation
- Improve visibility into Development Fund structure and lifecycle
- Introduce milestone-tracking transparency mechanisms
- Establish recurring quarterly transparency reporting

This work enhances coordination and trust across ecosystem stakeholders without modifying protocol logic.

---

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The initiative is implemented in three layers:

**Layer 1 – Governance Mapping Framework**
- Structured documentation of CIP-0082 and CIP-0100
- Governance lifecycle visualization
- Allocation flow modeling

**Layer 2 – Transparency Dashboard (MVP)**
- Interactive, section-based governance dashboard
- Dynamic proposal tracking model
- Automated status metrics calculation
- Development Fund allocation visualization (animated)
- Dark/light mode support
- Public deployment via GitHub Pages

**Layer 3 – Quarterly Transparency Reporting**
- Standardized reporting template
- Milestone tracking summaries
- Governance activity overview
- Ecosystem risk and outlook commentary

The dashboard prototype demonstrates implementation feasibility and will evolve toward structured data integration.

---

### 3. Architectural Alignment

This proposal:

- Operates within the governance structure defined by CIP-0082 and CIP-0100
- Does not modify consensus, protocol logic, or validator mechanics
- Supports milestone-based Development Fund oversight
- Enhances transparency at the ecosystem documentation and reporting layer

The initiative complements existing Canton Foundation processes and strengthens visibility around governance execution.

---

### 4. Backward Compatibility

No backward compatibility impact.

The initiative introduces documentation and reporting infrastructure only and does not alter existing protocol or validator systems.

---

## Milestones and Deliverables

### Milestone 1: Governance & Transparency Framework (MVP)

Estimated Delivery: 4 weeks  

Focus:
- Governance documentation formalization
- Allocation model clarification
- MVP dashboard implementation
- Quarterly report template finalization

Deliverables / Value Metrics:
- Publicly accessible interactive dashboard (live)
- Structured governance documentation
- Standardized transparency reporting template
- Demonstrated milestone-tracking model

---

### Milestone 2: Data Model Formalization & Reporting Integration

Estimated Delivery: 6–8 weeks  

Focus:
- Formalization of proposal tracking schema
- Structured data integration framework
- Report automation groundwork
- Documentation refinement

Deliverables / Value Metrics:
- Structured proposal metadata schema
- Enhanced dashboard functionality
- Versioned quarterly transparency report publication
- Technical documentation package

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The Tech & Ops Committee will evaluate completion based on:

- Deliverables completed as specified for each milestone
- Demonstrated functional dashboard deployment
- Public accessibility of reporting artifacts
- Clear documentation of governance mapping and allocation model
- Alignment with stated transparency objectives

Project-specific acceptance conditions:

- Dashboard must be publicly accessible
- Reporting template must be reproducible and versioned
- Documentation must clearly reference relevant CIPs

---

## Funding

Total Funding Request: 50,000 CC

### Payment Breakdown by Milestone

Milestone 1 – Infrastructure Foundation (25,000 CC)
Payment Trigger: Functional MVP delivery, governance mapping framework publication, lifecycle model formalization, and documentation package submitted for Committee review.

Milestone 2 – Production Hardening & Standardization (25,000 CC)
Payment Trigger: Release of finalized transparency dashboard, structured reporting framework, public reporting template, and operational readiness validation.

Funding Justification

The requested funding reflects structured development, architectural modeling, reporting standardization, documentation formalization, and ecosystem-facing infrastructure delivery over an 8–10 week milestone cycle.

This proposal establishes a reusable governance transparency framework aligned with CIP-0082 and CIP-0100, intended to serve as a public-good infrastructure layer for Canton ecosystem contributors.

The scope includes:
- Governance process modeling and visualization
- Development Fund lifecycle standardization
- Reporting template framework
- Operational documentation
- Public dashboard implementation
- Production hardening and usability refinement

The funding level reflects infrastructure-grade contribution rather than a lightweight interface implementation.

---

### Volatility Stipulation

If project duration exceeds 6 months:

Grant is denominated in fixed Canton Coin and may require re-evaluation at the 6-month mark.

If under 6 months:

Any Committee-requested scope extensions beyond 6 months may require milestone renegotiation to account for material USD/CC volatility.

---

## Co-Marketing

Upon milestone release, the implementing entity will collaborate with the Foundation on:

- Coordinated announcement
- Technical blog or case study
- Ecosystem developer outreach
- Transparency report publication visibility

---

## Motivation

Canton’s rapid ecosystem growth increases the importance of governance transparency and milestone accountability.

By formalizing documentation, reporting, and public visibility mechanisms, this initiative strengthens trust, coordination, and long-term ecosystem resilience.

---

## Rationale

This approach is preferred because:

- It operates at the documentation and transparency layer, avoiding protocol risk.
- It leverages existing governance structures under CIP-0082 and CIP-0100.
- It introduces structured reporting without requiring protocol modification.
- It enables incremental enhancement rather than disruptive change.

The live dashboard prototype demonstrates practical feasibility while preserving architectural neutrality.
